        <span>Hi Mariana,</span>
        <p>
          I am Alex, Antonio’s best friend. I need to ask you a favor. 
          Can you please send me your notes from class? 
          I can’t find mine and I need them to do the homework. 
        </p>
        <p>Thanks a lot</p>

        <span>Hello Jaime, </span>
        <p>
          I am Sofia, the girl with the green eyes and short hair who sits in front of the professor.
          My dog has seven puppies now and I can’t have so many of them. <br/>I know you love dogs and maybe you want to adopt one of the babies, what do you think? 
          Please respond back to let me know if you are interested 
        </p>
        <p>Thank you </p>

      <span>Good afternoon Mr Rodriguez,</span> 
      <p>I am Candelaria, the student with curly hair who had the accident in the lab last week. </p>
      <p>I need to do the activities you assigned for homework, but I do not have the photocopies to do it. 
      Can you please tell me where can I find them or can you send me the email addresses of some of my classmates, 
      so I can ask them to share the copies with me?</p>
      <p>Thanks in advance,</p>
