      <p>
        Yes, I love animals very much and I am interested in one, please send me photographs for me to select one.
        Maybe my girlfriend wants one too, but I need to ask her first.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for your offer.</p>`

      <span>Good evening miss,</span>
      <p>I certainly remember you,<br/>I left the photocopies in my folder in the photocopy place at building 13, the one next to the auditorium. 
      You can pick them up from there or you can ask one of your classmates to send you the copies to your email because I do not have them in digital version. 
      I am sending you the list of e-mail addresses of your classmates.</p>
      <p>See you</p>`,

        I remember you and my sister likes you too, but she has a boyfriend.
        She doesn’t allow me to give her phone number. 
        I am sorry! Next time you see her you can ask her ok?

      <span>Hi,</span>
      <p>I am sorry to say, but I don’t have space for a pet in my small apartment, 
      it’s a shame!<br/>Why don’t you ask Santiago, 
      I know he loves animals too and he lives in a big house.</p>
